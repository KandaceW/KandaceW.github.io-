## **My 1st BLOG ever**

### *Kandace Willcox - Foundations - Dev Academy - 2018*

# **Where do I start?**


- Well ill start with the basics - who, why, what etc... Im a Mum of 2 beatifull humans, a hairdresser and a self employed business owner. I want change I want challenge and I want to find the old drive that I used to have and the focus I was once able to produce. At Dev and during  the first 2 weeks of Foundations I have had a majorly major brain shif, over haul, crushing power drainage or what ever you can relate it to. Already in week one I fell a week behind and now entering week 3 I am doing my Sprint 2 at a pace I hope is atleast considered to be mediocre.something short I am a week behind and there is _ONLY_ 3 weeks left! Everyone (that i am aware of) has excelled in the tech and I have only just come to terms with the basics of sprint 1! Not only did I have to retrain my entire brain to be wired to focus follow instruction and learn something I didnt think was quite a foriegn as it turned out to be, but I completly and utterly **CONFUSED THE FREAKING HELL** out of myself by making two new Workspace folders in 2 diff locations. so I was never able to find my Repos or the folder had something old or different or it was completly missing folders and files I was **_sooooooooooo_** happy and mad with myself to discover I was not actually MAD yet I was how ever **SUPER STUPID**.
