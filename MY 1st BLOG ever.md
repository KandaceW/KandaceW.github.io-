# **Where do I start?**


- Well ill start with something short I am a week behind and there is 3 weeks left! Everyone (that i am aware of) has excelled in the tech and I have only just come to terms with the basics of sprint 1! Not only did I have to retrain my entire brain to be wired to focus follow instruction and learn something I didnt think was quite a foriegn as it turned out to be, but I completly and utterly **CONFUSED THE FREAKING HELL** out of myself by making two new Workspace folders in 2 diff locations. so I was never able to find my Repos or the folder had something old or different or it was completly missing folders and files I was **_sooooooooooo_** happy and mad with myself to discover I was not actually MAD yet I was how ever **SUPER STUPID**.
