                {P} - Well ill start with the basics who, why, what etc... Im a Mum of 2 beautiful humans, a hairdresser and a self employed business owner. I will myself big change, I want a challenge, and I need to find the old drive that I used to have and the focus I was once able to produce. At Dev Academy, during  the first 2 weeks of Foundations I have had a major brain realignment/over haul/shift... major power drain - what ever you can relate it to. Its been ridiculously emotional and when I look at how many hours toggled I am like WTF! I didn't see my kids yet they were in my care, I was pissed off and upset and all the way through **frustrated** as hell but also secretly my will power was creeping back. I even mentioned quitting and almost feeling like going through with it on many occasion! but I have never been like that Im far too stubborn and competitive and also I Jumped into this I am going to make it a success and if i don't then i will forever regret it! After being so stuck on sprint-1 (which ill write about in another blog entry) I fell a week behind so basically this is me catching up and i will be leaving some "what super dumb things you just shouldn't do" tips with my blog on Sprint-1 in the nearish future. thanks for reading this 1st entry to my 1st ever self made blog/web page etc I hope I can catch up and be of help not hinder come **BOOT CAMP**
